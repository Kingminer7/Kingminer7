# Kingminer7
I'm a coding nerd, although I do actually take breaks unlike some devs.
I code for fun, learned mostly from YouTube guides and reverse engineering.

### I code in...
Lua<br>
Java<br>
Javascript<br>
PHP/SQL<br>
HTML<br>
C#<br>
Python<br>
Some others I probably forgot

### Stuff that kind of counts but not really
Minecraft commands<br>
Geometry dash triggers<br>
Scratch (I have MAJOR regrets here)
