# km7 dev
I code random projects that I usually don't finish.
I code for fun, learned mostly from YouTube guides and reverse engineering.

### I code in...
Lua<br>
Java<br>
Javascript<br>
PHP/SQL<br>
HTML<br>
C#<br>
Python<br>
Some others I probably forgot

### Stuff that kind of counts but not really
Minecraft commands<br>
Geometry dash triggers (including 2.2 triggers)<br>
